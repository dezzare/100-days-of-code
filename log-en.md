# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#### ###Day 0: January 18, 2022

***Today's Progress**: solution of 40 basic exercises of JS on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I understand that the course is made for beginners, but the start was so boring, just simples exercises, any of it was challenging. Only shows basic concepts of var, basic math, and some words about array. It is for someone that never seen anything of programming. It was easy and boring/disappointing because of that.

**Link to work**: none, there was only boring stuff.

#### ###Day 1: January 19, 2022

***Today's Progress**: I got stuck in an exercise. It becomes to be clear what is my weakness.
I wasn't finding a typed error, a dot, and should be a comma. So I need an appointment with an Ophthalmologist. 

**Thoughts:** Today I was very excited by the start, keep going with FCC exercises about array, function, scope. Until I got into "If/Else", this part was so tedious, simple, then got into basic logic, the same thing, just pass throw without any problem, no attention was needed to resolve the exercises. 
Finally a new subject; "switch()". The concept is simple, just got a problem with one of the questions. This question demands me a lot of time. In my mind, the logic was perfect. I search deep in the documentation that Mozilla has. And I didn't know what was going wrong, was without a clue. At this point, I was disappointed with myself. 
Finally, I found the error. It was a type error, there was a dot that was supposed to be a comma. It is clear my weakness, I need an appointment with an Ophthalmologist.

#### ###Day 2: January 20, 2022

***Today's Progress**: I'm struggling with my lack of knowledge. I pushed myself to go deep into the study of objects.  And, I had good times testing methods.

**Thoughts:** TNow things got interesting: objects. I'm struggling with my lack of knowledge. I pushed myself to go deep into the study of objects.  
For my study, I use w3schools (w3schools.com) and MDN Web Docs (developer.mozilla.org). I had good times testing methods and hadn't felt the time passed. That's why, at the end of the day, had solved just a few exercises. But the coding tests were of a huge value.
Until now, I have concluded 95 exercises of 299 that FreeCodeCamp proposes for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures formation.

#### ###Day 3: January 21 , 2022

***Today's Progress**: Spent 40min looking for the missing piece of my code. And was a "=" after a "<", on the conditional logic.

**Thoughts:** Today, the grinding on FCC exercises was slow. Still have problems with "objects". I had got a hard time with one exercise about recursivity.
It was needed to set up an array only using functions, without any form of loop (for, while). I spent about 40min on this, and my error was simple to solve: just add "=" after "<". Yes, just because of this I spent 40min searching for the reason that my code wasn't working.

#### ###Day 4: January 22 , 2022

***Today's Progress**: Saw new ways to do some things, with ES6 "new" aproach.

**Thoughts:** Resuming the FCC saga at the part of ES6 exercises. My progress today was slow but very interesting. Saw some things different than the way I had learned until now. That gives me the joy to have learned something new.

### ###Day 5: January 23 , 2022

***Today's Progress**: The subject of study: export/import. I was aware of the existence of this functionality but never saw it in practice. I had spent some time here, studying and testing.

**Thoughts:** Got some fun.

### ###Day 6: January 24 , 2022

***Today's Progress**:  I'm feeling tired of the JS exercises in FCC. They are so simples, basics, just writing one or two lines of code. But, I still keep going on it.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling tired of the JS exercises in FCC. They are so simples, basics, just writing one or two lines of code. I still keep going on it. But, I looked for some challenges. I remember that I had some classes, of "Introduction to Structured Programming with C", to watch online in college. I was delaying these classes because, in my mind, C was a hard thing. 
F***!! It is almost the same thing as JavaScript.

### ###Day 7: January 25 , 2022

***Today's Progress**: One more day with C, and very productive. A lot of exercises about it, all of them on my GitHub:

**Thoughts:** Feeling productive.

### ###Day 8: January 26, 2022

***Today's Progress**: Today the topic was: regex. The last time I had used regex was 22 years ago, in a Linux Course. I expected to be rusty, but not so rusty. And come back to me why I never wanted to use it, there have so much "/" and "\" that's overwhelming.

### ###Day 9: January 27 , 2022

***Today's Progress**: Finally finished Debug and Basic Data Structures exercises. At this point, I'm 207/299 of the training about JS on FreeCodeCamp.  And I had time for 2 exercises on LeetCode: Two Sum and Palindrome Number (put my solution on my Github).

### ###Day 10: January 28 , 2022

***Today's Progress**: Resolve all Basic Data Scripting exercises on FreeCodeCamp. And it's becoming to be clear that I need to focus my study on Array and Objects. Especially on manipulation of Arrays and Objects, methods, and prototypes. 

### ###Day 11: January 29, 2022

***Today's Progress**: I have resolved all exercises of Objects on FCC. But it can't be that simple. I don't feel that is just it. Definitely, it has more subject about Objects, and I need to research it. Studying in baby steps isn't for me. I want to know what/why and don't be limited to just how. I need to go deep.
