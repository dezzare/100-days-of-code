## Commitment

As someones already know, I started a new bachelor formation (Development Information Technology). 

That's made me look for courses in a programming language, and study a lot of things that I never heard before. Some of the books and articles are only published in English. Then, this took me to a point where I needed to practice my English.

So, I decided to change habits and made public my enforcement to get better in programming and practice my English, by committing to this challenge (code for the next 100 days).

The commitment to this challenge makes it easier to track the path that I took, for future analysis and to share my perspective of the challenges that appear.



##Here are some rules/plans for this challenge:

1. Publish my progress every day.

2. Time coding at work (if I get one during the challenge) will not count.

3. Time spent on classes at college, tutorials and courses, will not count, except the time taken to resolve exercises.

4. Mostly, I will be working through FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

5. Other resources I will be working on:
   
   - Personal Home page (HTML + CSS + JS)
   
   - Challenges on websites, like LeetCode, AdventOfCode
   
   - Exercises proposed by books
   
   - Challenges proposed by YouTube channels, like [Filipe Deschamps](https://www.youtube.com/c/FilipeDeschamps)

6. I will push code to another repository, where I will maintain all the exercises that I made, including some ones that do not count to this challenge. All will be linked in the log reference
